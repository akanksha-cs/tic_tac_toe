Demo link: https://akanksha-cs.github.io/tic_tac_toe/

Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery.

Current functionalities include:
* Not-easy-to-beat AI. (Logic based on [Wikipedia's strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe#Strategy).)
* Choose to play as X or O.
* Start a new game after the current game is finished.

Future ideas include:
* Have the Xs and Os on the board be different colors.
* Adhere to standard Tic Tac Toe rules and always have X go first, whomever X may be.
* Create unbeatable AI using Wikipedia's strategy.
* Implement Minimax algorithm for AI logic.
